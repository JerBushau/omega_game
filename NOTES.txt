Create Levels and way to progress though levels

Learn more about vector based movement and kinematic formulas https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/kinematic-formulas/a/what-are-the-kinematic-formulas 
	to understand more about time based movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIiYJaY8ZR0&list=PLsk-HSGFjnaHYvbjMbTQG6kLhhZHLzdb3&index=2

All projectiles and other on screen entities that move should inherit from entity class so that they can benefit from vector based movement

Create more robust player class that takes a weapon and ship parameter
