Player movement 
	- left/right a & d
	- weapon is a turret with 180 degree pivot radius

Add controller support

Make Win/Loose messages a scene with a timer or button instead

All projectiles and other on screen entities that move should inherit from entity class so that they can benefit from vector based movement

Create more robust player class that takes a weapon and ship parameter

Create notification system

Add player abilities such as armor, increased attack speed, shield that pushes enemies within a given radius away from player

Create ship class. Weapon should take ammo param and ship should take the weap

Create a base class (based on Entity class) for enemies allowing for more robust enemies in the future

Create at least one real boss and boss fight

Decide whether or not to go side scroller vs static vs top scroller
