Notification system improvements
	- power ups/effects
	- System messages (you died, you win, character dialog, level information, etc...)

Cut scenes before bosses

Add controller support -- https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/joystick.html#module-pygame.joystick

Add player abilities such as armor, increased attack speed, shield that pushes enemies within a given radius away from player

Set up constants so aspec ratio can be set

Post game scene to display score and allow for upgrades

New art: weapons, ships, enemies, bosses, sheilds, various power up effects, ammo projectiles,

Learn about and add particle effects

Make Win/Loose messages a scene with a timer or button instead

All projectiles and other on screen entities that move should inherit from entity class so that they can benefit from vector based movement

Base classes for Bosses and enemies

Base class for weapons

Create more robust player class that takes a ship parameter

Create ship class. Weapon should take ammo param and ship should take the weap

Decide whether or not to go side scroller vs static vs top scroller

  	- While green all dmg is converted to hp
  	- While red burst shot that is one hit kill
  	- While blue 'basic attack'
