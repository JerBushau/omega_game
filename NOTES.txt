https://github.com/justinmeister/pygame-animation-example/blob/master/animation_example.py -- a lot of good game examples on this GH
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsk-HSGFjnaHYvbjMbTQG6kLhhZHLzdb3 -- incredible resource
https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-physics/chapter/vectors/ -- move good info on vectors/scalars

Create game state engine to facilitate levels and way to progress though levels -- something like https://gist.github.com/iminurnamez/8d51f5b40032f106a847 or https://github.com/Mekire/pygame-mutiscene-template-with-movie 
	or pretty simple one at https://archives.seul.org/pygame/users/Jul-2007/msg00268.html

Add controller support

Learn more about vector based movement and kinematic formulas https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/kinematic-formulas/a/what-are-the-kinematic-formulas 
	to understand more about time based movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIiYJaY8ZR0&list=PLsk-HSGFjnaHYvbjMbTQG6kLhhZHLzdb3&index=2

All projectiles and other on screen entities that move should inherit from entity class so that they can benefit from vector based movement

Add player abilities such as armor, increased attack speed, shield that pushes enemies away from player within a given radius

Create more robust player class that takes a weapon and ship parameter

Create weapon, ammo, and ship class. Weapon should take ammo param and ship should take the weap

Create a base class (based on Entity class) for enemies allowing for more robust enemies in the future

Create at least one real boss and boss fight

Decide whether or not to go side scroller vs static vs top scroller
